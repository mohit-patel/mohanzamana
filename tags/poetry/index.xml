      <description>Many years ago (some say before the first copy was published) an unauthorised copy of 1001 Nights was found in Herat. It traveled west through the desert. A holy man washed it with zam zam water. It was then lost, buried under the great dunes. When the winds came howling in the great storm (during the life of Ibn Sina), it resurfaced. A great philosopher of the future read it. We do not know if this copy matched the authorised copy of 1001 Nights.</description>
